# Template repo for your rust project
This template includes a Github workflow that will:
 * Check the style (rustfmt + cargo clippy)
 * Test your code on rust stable, beta and nightly
 * Publish a new release when you push a tag on master in the form of `v*.*.*'
Just click on "Use as a template" and you're done
